# Seive of Eratosthenes

## Description

The _Sieve of Eratosthenes_ is a simple algorithm for finding all of the [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) up to a certain limit (or between two numbers).  

## Implementation

**_sieveOfEratosthenes(num)_** should return an array of all prime numbers up to _num_.

For example:

```
sieveOfEratosthenes(20) // [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
```
