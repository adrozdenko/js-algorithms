# FizzBuzz algorithm

*fizzBuzz(n)* should log in the console an array with numbers from 1 to n with the following rules:

>- numbers divided by 3 should be replaced on *'Fizz'* word.
>- numbers divided by 5 should be replaced on *'Buzz'* word.
>- numbers divided by 3 and 5 should be replaced on *'FizzBuzz'* word.


For example:

```
fizzBuzz(7)   // [1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7]
fizzBuzz(15)  // [1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz", 11, "Fizz", 13, 14, "FizzBuzz"]
```
