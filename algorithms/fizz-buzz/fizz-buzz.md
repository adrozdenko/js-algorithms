# FizzBuzz algorithm

**_fizzBuzz(n)_** should log in the console an array of numbers from _1_ to _n_ with the following rules:

>- numbers divided by 3 should be replaced on _'Fizz'_ word.
>- numbers divided by 5 should be replaced on _'Buzz'_ word.
>- numbers divided by 3 and 5 should be replaced on _'FizzBuzz'_ word.


For example:

```
fizzBuzz(7)  //   [1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7]
fizzBuzz(15) //   [1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz", 11, "Fizz", 13, 14, "FizzBuzz"]
```
